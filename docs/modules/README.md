# Module ecosystem overview

OpenConstructionERP is modular. Well over a hundred first-party modules ship in the box, and each one is a self-contained package that the platform discovers and mounts on start. You enable the ones a project needs and ignore the rest. This page groups the modules by area with a one-line description each, so you can see the full breadth and find the piece you are looking for. For the workflows that tie several modules together, read the [user guide](../user-guide/README.md). To build your own module, read the [platform and builder guide](../platform/README.md).

A module can depend on others, so enabling a workflow usually pulls in what it needs. Where a module is a thin analytical layer over data another module owns, that is noted, because it means the module adds a view rather than a new place to enter data.

## Estimating and the bill of quantities

The core estimating stack, from a first rough number to a fully qualified bill.

- Bill of Quantities - the core BOQ editor: hierarchical sections and positions, rates, calculations and export.
- Conceptual Estimate - an order-of-magnitude estimate from areas and unit counts before detail exists.
- Assemblies and Calculations - reusable rate recipes built from labour, material and equipment components.
- Estimating Methodologies - the method behind an estimate, so the approach is recorded, not just the number.
- Basis of Estimate - auto-drafts the inclusions, exclusions and assumptions that qualify a proposal.
- Allowances and Contingency - provisional sums, prime-cost sums and contingencies with a running drawdown.
- Preliminaries - general conditions and site establishment priced as time-related and fixed items.
- Waste Factors - net-to-gross quantity adjustment with waste, lap and coverage factors.
- Labor and Crew Rates - all-in labour rate build-up and composite crew rates.
- Production-Norm Expansion - expands a work item into unpriced labour, machine and material demand from norm coefficients.
- Resource Summary - rolls per-position resource splits into one procurement-ready schedule.
- Estimate Rollup - consolidates estimates into portfolio and program totals.
- Formwork - a formwork system catalogue with reuse-aware unit-cost computation.
- Design Options - generate and compare priced design variants side by side.
- Value Realized - composes figures the platform already computes into a project and portfolio value summary.

## Cost data and catalogs

The rates and resources an estimate draws on, and the tools to search and compare them.

## Building your own

Every module in this list is a Python package under `backend/app/modules/` with a manifest, and yours can be too. The platform discovers it, mounts its API, registers its data models and wires its validation on the next restart, with no central file to edit. Start with the [platform and builder guide](../platform/README.md) and the [module development quickstart](../module-development/quickstart.md).
