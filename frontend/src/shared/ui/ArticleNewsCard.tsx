/**
 * ArticleNewsCard - a compact promo card pinned near the foot of the sidebar
 * that links out to the featured long-form article on the uberization of
 * construction. It reuses the sidebar card frame (same width, radius, border,
 * shadow and entrance animation) and opens the article in a new tab.
 *
 * This used to embed a YouTube video; it now points at the written article
 * instead, so the whole card is a single external link with a title, a short
 * subtitle and an external-link affordance. It keeps the existing
 * `sidebar.video_news.*` i18n keys for the title/subtitle.
 *
 * Collapsed by default: only the title shows so the block stays quiet at the
 * foot of the sidebar. On hover (or keyboard focus, for accessibility) the
 * subtitle and the "Read the article" affordance expand into view. The whole
 * card is a link in both states, so it is always clickable - hovering just
 * reveals the detail before the click.
 *
 * Dismissal: the card can be closed with the corner button. It is not a
 * permanent hide - it reopens on the next app load so the article keeps a
 * gentle second (and final) chance to be seen. Only after the user has closed
 * it MAX_DISMISSALS times does it stay hidden for good. The count is read once
 * per mount, so a fresh session shows the card again as long as the stored
 * count is still below the cap.
