"""Service-level behaviour of cost matching against a real database.

Covers the things only rows can show: what retrieval actually pulls out of a
cost base, which tier each scored line lands in, that identical lines are
scored once and not once each, that a ruling is an append-only record rather
than a flag, and that the relationship loading strategies declared on the
models behave the way the loading policy says they must.

The four seeded cost items are in ``conftest.py``. Every expected tier below is
derived by hand from those descriptions and the matcher's published formula, so
a change in scoring surfaces here rather than in production.
