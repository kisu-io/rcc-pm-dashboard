"""Migrations must not declare new native PostgreSQL UUID columns.

``Base.metadata.create_all`` is the source of truth for our schema, and it
emits ``character varying(36)`` for every identity column: measured across all
598 tables, 597 are ``varchar(36)``, one is ``varchar(64)``, and none are
``uuid``. That is because ``GUID`` in ``app.database`` is a ``TypeDecorator``
whose ``impl`` is ``String(36)`` with no ``load_dialect_impl``, so it renders
the same on every dialect.

A migration that declares ``postgresql.UUID`` therefore describes a column
shape that ``create_all`` never produces. Nothing breaks today, because the
canonical install runs ``create_all`` and stamps the head without walking the
chain, so those declarations are not executed. They are only reachable by
walking the chain from base, and that walk currently fails: a revision creates
a child with ``document_id uuid`` referencing a parent whose ``id`` is
``varchar(36)``, and PostgreSQL refuses the foreign key with
``DatatypeMismatch``.

The decision recorded here is that the divergence is frozen rather than
repaired. Reconciling it would mean rewriting the revisions that already
declare these columns, which is a multi-day project gated on questions nobody
has answered. This guard does the affordable half: it stops the gap growing.
The allowlist below is closed. A new entry is not the fix.

The revisions are read with ``ast`` rather than imported, for the same reasons
as ``test_alembic_single_head``: importing them drags in ``app.database`` and a
PostgreSQL URL, and an unrelated import error anywhere in the 300-plus files
would silently disable the check.

The rule is deliberately coarse: any reference to a native UUID type in a
revision is a violation, whether or not this file can prove it reaches a
column. That is not laziness, it is the lesson from building the precise
version first. No current offender writes the type inline, because the same
revision has to work on SQLite, so the type reaches the column through at
least one indirection::

    guid_type = sa.String(36) if is_sqlite else sa.dialects.postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=True)
    sa.Column("document_id", guid_type, nullable=False)

A detector matching ``sa.Column`` arguments literally sees a bare name and
passes. Resolving assignments fixes that case and still missed
``v3012_equipment``, which returns the type from a helper and receives it as a
function parameter::

    def _guid_type(is_sqlite): return sa.String(36) if is_sqlite else postgresql.UUID()
    def _base_columns(guid_type): return [sa.Column("id", guid_type, primary_key=True)]

Every indirection added to the detector is a new way to fall through it, and a
site the guard cannot resolve counts as clean - which is how a guard ends up
enforcing nothing. Matching the type reference itself has no such gap.

The one exemption is ``existing_type=``. A migration that repairs the
divergence has to name ``UUID`` to say what the column is being converted
*from*, and that is the direction we want, not a new violation.
