"""Cost-match business logic.

This is where the pure matcher meets the database. The split is deliberate and
worth keeping: :mod:`app.modules.cost_match.matcher` knows nothing about
sessions, rows or users and is therefore trivially testable, while everything
that has to persist, page, authorise or be reviewed lives here.

The three tiers
---------------
Every submitted line is scored against a bounded pool of cost items and lands
in exactly one tier:

* ``exact``           - the normalised descriptions are word-for-word equal and
                        the units agree. Nothing to argue about.
* ``high_confidence`` - scored at or above :data:`~matcher.HIGH_CONFIDENCE`.
* ``needs_review``    - scored between :data:`~matcher.REVIEW_CONFIDENCE` and
                        that. Plausible, and a person decides.
* ``unmatched``       - below the review floor. The closest candidate is still
                        recorded for context, exactly as the matcher offers it,
                        together with the matcher's own hint about what to try
                        next - but the tier does not claim it is a match.

Nothing is applied automatically
--------------------------------
The tier is what the machine found, never what the project adopts. A result
becomes usable only when a person confirms, overrides or rejects it, and that
ruling is written as its own row carrying the reviewer, the moment, and the
confidence the machine was showing at the time. An ``exact`` match is presented
first and still waits for a human. That is platform rule 7, and
``cost_match.decision_has_reviewer`` is the rule that catches a violation.
