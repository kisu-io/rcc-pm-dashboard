"""Cost-match data access layer.

Two kinds of query live here:

* the module's own three tables, read the way the review screens read them
  (a page of a run's results, the needs-review queue, the aggregated counts);
* retrieval against the cost base, which is a **read-only** query over
  :class:`~app.modules.costs.models.CostItem`. Following the convention set by
  ``cost_explorer``, the cost item model is imported directly and this module
  builds its own ``select()`` rather than reaching through the costs service.

Retrieval matters more than it looks. The matcher is a pure in-memory scorer
with no notion of a database, so whatever this layer returns is the entire
universe the match is chosen from. Handing it the whole base would be both
slow and pointless; handing it a naive ``ILIKE`` on the pasted phrase would
lose every cross-language hit, which is the one thing the matcher exists to
get right.

So a description is broken into retrieval terms and each term goes through
``costs.repository.synonym_text_predicate``, the platform's shared
multilingual construction-vocabulary predicate, which expands one word into
its cross-language group at SQL level. That predicate takes a single term (it
folds and looks up the whole string it is given), so feeding it the phrase
would silently collapse to a substring match on the phrase - the exact failure
this module cannot afford.

The terms are the description's own words **and** the matcher's
:func:`~app.modules.cost_match.matcher.canonical_tokens` for it. The second
half is what carries a Russian or Spanish line onto an English base row: the
matcher maps every language's word for a concept onto one shared English
token, so retrieval ends up asking the database the same question the scorer
will ask in memory. Retrieval and scoring agreeing on the vocabulary is what
keeps a bounded pool from quietly dropping the right answer.
