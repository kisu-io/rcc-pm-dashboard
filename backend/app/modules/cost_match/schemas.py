"""Cost-match Pydantic schemas - request / response models.

Money and quantities are ``Decimal`` in memory and serialise as strings, per
the platform's "Decimal as string" contract: a unit rate that crosses the wire
as a JSON number loses precision in every JavaScript client that reads it.

Confidence is also serialised as a string for the same reason. It is a
four-decimal ``Decimal`` in the database and a float in the pure matcher, and
letting it drift between the two representations is how a "0.75" boundary
becomes 0.7499999999999999 in a client-side comparison.
