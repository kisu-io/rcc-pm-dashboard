"""Pure completeness and arithmetic checks for a subcontract agreement.

Validation is first-class for this module (platform principle #4). A
subcontract agreement leaving ``draft`` for ``active`` is the moment a
subcontractor may start work, raise payment applications against the scope and
accrue retention. Everything downstream reads the agreement rather than
re-deriving it: :meth:`SubcontractorService.sov_summary` divides by the
agreement's ``total_value``, :meth:`accrue_retention` multiplies by its
``retention_percent``, and the payment-application chain settles in its
``currency``. An agreement that goes live with a zero value, a blank currency
or work packages worth more than the contract produces reports nobody can
reconcile, and the error surfaces weeks later inside a payment claim.

Like ``procurement/validators.py`` this module is deliberately
**dependency-free**: standard library plus :class:`~decimal.Decimal`, no ORM,
no FastAPI, no session. The rule classes in ``app.core.validation.rules`` stay
thin wrappers translating a :class:`Finding` into a ``RuleResult``, so the
checks themselves are unit-testable without a database.

Payload shape
-------------
The service flattens an agreement, its work packages and the parts of the
subcontractor row these checks need into one dict. Money arrives as Decimal
strings and dates as ``YYYY-MM-DD`` strings, both parsed here rather than by
the caller.

The clock is data, never ``date.today()``
-----------------------------------------
Every date-relative check reads :data:`AS_OF_KEY` from the payload. The service
fills it with today's date; a test passes it explicitly. A rule that asks the
system clock what day it is cannot be pinned by a test that still passes next
year, so no check in this module calls ``today()``.
